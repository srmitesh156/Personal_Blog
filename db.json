      "Description": "Hello there, I am currently a student enrolled in a Web Design and App. Development course at SU. I have a few skills that I believe translate well into having a good career.\n\nFirstly, I can play multiple instruments including the main 4 wooden orchestra instruments, guitar, bass-guitar, and piano. I bring this up as I believe it shows that I enjoy and I am capable of learning multiple things."
